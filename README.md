A simple board to turn any oscilloscope into a current meter by running the load through the "LOAD" Terminals and connecting your oscilloscope to the "MEASURE" terminals. 

The resistor footprint takes a 2512 SMD resistor which usually come with a rating of 1 to 3 watts which is enough to run several amps through this board. 

The connector footprints are made for the Altech/Hirschmann PB 4 4mm test jacks that take a 4mm test lead. You can also use the M3 screw holes to connect to this board.
